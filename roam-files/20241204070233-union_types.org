#+startup: overview

- a data type that allows a variable to hold values of different types
- but only one type at a time

 - commonly used to optimize memory usage by using the same memory location for different types as needed

- In some programming languages, union types are explicitly defined, while in others, they may be represented through language features like type unions or tagged unions
